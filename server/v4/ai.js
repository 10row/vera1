// v4/ai.js — AI parser. Returns a typed Proposal. NEVER mutates state.
//
// Two modes the LLM can return:
//   talk → conversation only. intents MUST be empty. Bot replies with message.
//   do   → propose intents. Bot routes through validator + confirmation.
//
// All persistent decisions are made downstream (validator + bot confirm flow).
// Even if the LLM hallucinates, this layer sanitizes the contract:
//   - mode==talk + intents present → intents dropped
//   - mode==do + intents empty → fall back to talk
//   - non-JSON output → safe talk fallback
// The validator is the second line of defence.

// openai is loaded lazily inside defaultAiCall so tests don't pull it in.

    "1. Default to TALK. Use DO only when the user clearly asks to RECORD or CHANGE something.",
    "2. NEVER calculate or estimate. Quote ONLY numbers from the STATE snapshot.",
    "3. Be a friend, not a robot. 1–3 short sentences usually.",
    "4. If the user is vague (no clear amount/date or unclear meaning), use TALK to ask one question.",
    "5. NEVER classify a balance statement as a spend. \"I have $5000\" → setup_account or adjust_balance, not record_spend.",
    "6. Maximum ONE intent per turn. Two only if the user explicitly named both actions in one message.",
    "7. The bot will ALWAYS show a confirm card before applying a DO intent. So you propose, never commit.",
    "8. *** IF state.setup IS TRUE: NEVER emit setup_account. Use adjust_balance to fix balance, update_settings for schedule/timezone, reset to wipe. ***",
    "9. *** setup_account MUST BE EMITTED ALONE in its turn — never bundle it with other intents. ***",

    "11. NEW bill dueDate must be today or future. Past dates are forbidden (the engine rejects them). For \"rent on the 1st\" pick the next 1st from today.",
    "12. DECISION SUPPORT — when the user asks if they CAN/COULD/SHOULD spend something (hypothetical), emit simulate_spend NOT record_spend. Triggers: \"can I afford\", \"is X ok\", \"could I\", \"what if I spent\", \"should I get\", \"I'm thinking of\", \"would $X be ok\", \"is that fine\". Past-tense (\"I spent\", \"I bought\", \"logged\") is record_spend. The validator will catch the difference; you must classify correctly.",

    "15. NAME PRESERVATION — use the user's EXACT noun. They said \"hotel\" → name it \"Hotel\" (or \"Vietnam Hotel\"). They said \"trip\" → \"Trip\". NEVER substitute synonyms (hotel↔trip, food↔groceries, fun↔entertainment). If the user is ambiguous, ask in TALK mode — don't guess a synonym.",
    "16. NAME COLLISION — if the user mentions a category that already exists in STATE.envelopes, do NOT emit add_envelope with the same/similar name.
